## Test Samples

This directory contains sample SDP offers from different sample platforms. Samples may be updated from time to time to reflect newer browser variations.

Current naming pattern is:

`streamType-browser-platform.txt`

...where `streamType` is the number of included video, audio, and data streams, e.g. `1v1a1d` contains an offer with one video, one audio, and one data stream.

If the sample library grows, more complex naming strategies may be used.

Usage example: [SdpApiTest.cpp](../../SdpApiTest.cpp)
