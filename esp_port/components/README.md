# ESP-IDF Components

This directory contains ESP-IDF components that are required for the Amazon KVS WebRTC SDK port to ESP32 devices. These components provide the necessary functionality for WebRTC communication, media streaming, and device-specific features.

These components can be used in ESP-IDF projects by adding them as dependencies in the project's `idf_component.yml` file.
