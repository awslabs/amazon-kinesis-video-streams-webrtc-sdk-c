# WebRTC Bridge
- The communication bridge between Signalling and Streaming part of the WebRTC.
- When running with [split mode](../../README.md#split_mode), we need a bridge between Signalling device and the Streaming device running respective parts of the WebRTC.
- By default, i.e., the bridge used is esp_hosted. It is also possible to use MQTT as the bridge.
